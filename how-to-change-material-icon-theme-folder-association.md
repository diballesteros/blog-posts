## How to change Material Icon Theme folder association

How to change [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) folder association
I really love the Material Icon Theme for Visual studio code. It’s very visually appealing and helps me quickly mentally locate whatever I need inside the explorer.

However, not all folder names and types are covered by default. But, they do offer a way to add your own associations with custom icons as well pre-existing icons.

Changing the icon
In this example, I’ll be changing the icon for a folder named cypress. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used for end-to-end testing so I figured I should change the default Icon to something more oriented for testing.

First, let’s go ahead and open up Visual Studio Code and hit CTRL + SHIFT + p

This should open up possible commands. Type in User Settings.

Upon opening them up, we can see the search bar, search for folder icon.

In Material-icon-theme > Folders: Associations click on “Edit in settings.json”

There should be a section called material-icon-theme.folders.associations

Inside we can start changing the folder associations

I updated it to include cypress with the test folder association.

For default images this can be used as a reference:

Now cypress will show up with the updated icon:

And that’s it! Let me know in the comments below if you have any other material icon theme customizations you use!
