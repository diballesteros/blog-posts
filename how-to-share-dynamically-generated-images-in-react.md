## How to share dynamically generated images in React

I have been developing a [pokémon related app](https://nuzlocke.netlify.app) where you can track encounters. Throughout the process I also added a way to generate a summary image of the run:

Generating the image was easy enough, but typically most users would want to share that image directly to a social media site. In comes the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share)! With this it can natively check for methods from the OS to share the site, so direct integration with Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc is unnecessary.

**DISCLAIMER**: For the time being this API has limited compatibility across some operating systems and browsers. Check out https://caniuse.com/?search=navigator.share for the current state.

## The Requirements

- Share button
- Dynamically generate an image from the HTML
- When clicking the share button share the image to a variety of different options

## The Setup

Before anything else, to dynamically generate the image a third-party library is necessary. In this tutorial, I will be using [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image). Cool! Now, let’s go ahead and start setting up the share button.

```js
<div>
   <h1>Dynamically generate and share images</h1>
   <button>Share</button>
   <div>
       // ...Dynamically generated content
   </div>
</div>
```

Simple enough. In order to extract the content let’s set up html-to-image. First, we need to hook up the div that’s going to contain the dynamic content with a ref using the useRef hook from React.
 
```js
const imageRef = useRef(null);

<div>
   <h1>Dynamically generate and share images</h1>
   <button>Share</button>
   <div ref={imageRef}>
       // ...Dynamically generated content
   </div>
</div>
```

## Create and share the image

html-to-image provides us with a function to directly take out the HTML element and create an image: toBlob. Here we create the function:

```js
const handleShare = async () => {
    const newFile = await toBlob(imageRef.current);
    const data = {
      files: [
        new File([newFile], 'image.png', {
          type: newFile.type,
        }),
      ],
      title: 'Image',
      text: 'image',
    };
}
```

Also, we must format the result to correctly be able to share. We can do this by making the image into a Blob by extracting the current value from the Ref as well as setting a title and text.

```js
const handleShare = async () => {
    const newFile = await toBlob(imageRef.current);
    const data = {
      files: [
        new File([newFile], 'image.png', {
          type: newFile.type,
        }),
      ],
      title: 'Image',
      text: 'image',
    };

    try {
      await navigator.share(data);
   } catch (err) {
     console.error(err);
   }
}
```

Sharing the image is as simple as sharing the constructed data. This will automatically bring up a list of options available. But, wait! Earlier I mentioned compatibility issues, for that reason I added a try and catch, but we can take this a step further, the API also provides us a function to check if the data can be shared at all: navigator.canShare.

```js
  try {
      if (!navigator.canShare(data)) {
        console.error("Can't share");
      }
      await navigator.share(data);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    }
```

Check out the end result with the function hooked up to the button:
