## Quick TS Tips: How to extract a type from an array

Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom _nested_ types from the requests without it being too verbose.

But, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!

### The example

Let’s take for example this generated type (this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):

If we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.

### Extraction Type

The following type allows us to extract it:

It can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a [generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) receiving the array itself as T.
