### Introduction

The second part of my ongoing series on how to have a more modern approach to testing a React application. Last time I went over the tools I prefer using. ðŸ”¨

-   Cypress for End-to-End testing
-   Vitest for Unit Testing
-   MSW for mocking our services

In this post, Iâ€™ll go over how to install everything before heading into the testing.

When first getting into testing it can be a little daunting with so many sources claiming what is the ideal way to test and what are the best packages or frameworks to use. But, in order to appreciate the testing frameworks, itâ€™s important to see them in action in an application

I hope to give a very opinionated view on how to test in order to avoid decision paralysis and just get to testing!

### Setting up a React app for Testing

Iâ€™ve gone ahead and created a barebones application for the purposes of going through testing. You can find it here. This is the commit of its initial state [right here](https://github.com/diballesteros/react-testing/commit/b4514d2a3b6afc8f850e012264fbb949462afa62).

_GitHub repository files_

Itâ€™s a simple react application powered by Vite that loads posts from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) when a button is clicked.

Here is what it looks like:

_Fetching JSON, nothing fancy_

Just to give a very brief overview of the code:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
	const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
	const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

	const fetchPosts = async () => {
		setLoading(true);
		const response = await fetch(
			'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
		);
		const json = await response.json();
		setPosts(json);
		setLoading(false);
	};

	const clearPosts = () => {
		setPosts([]);
	};

	return (
		<div className="App">
			<header className="App-header">
				<h1>Modern React Testing</h1>
			</header>
			<main className="App-content">
				<section className="App-buttons">
					<button onClick={fetchPosts} type="button">
						Fetch Posts
					</button>
					<button onClick={clearPosts} type="button">
						Clear posts
					</button>
				</section>
				{loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
				{posts.map((post) => (
					<article key={post.id}>
						<h3>{post.title}</h3>
						<p>{post.body}</p>
					</article>
				))}
			</main>
		</div>
	);
}
```

We have two functions:

-   **fetchPostsâ€Š** â€”â€ŠCalls the endpoint and fetches posts with a title, body, and id. This is set inside our local state
-   **clearPosts** â€Šâ€”â€ŠResets the local state to an empty array

These posts are then iterated over and displayed with a **map** function.

### Why this application?

![why in letter blocks](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650898962160/GRZv40fuic.jpeg)

Fetching, transforming, and displaying a request to an API is probably the most common task in application development. This app will allow us to test exactly those things.

Weâ€™ll eventually go on to **mock** the JSON service with MSW. Do some end-to-end visual testing with Cypress and go through **how a test can be created** with their test-runner. Finally, with Vitest weâ€™ll create some unit tests to go gain some confidence around our **individual components** and **transformation functions**.

I tried to keep it as simple as possible to focus on whatâ€™s important to us. The testing! ðŸ’¯

### Setting up the Testing Packages

This will just be a simple package installation:

For Vitest:

```
npm install -D vitest
```

For Cypress:

```
npm install -D cypress
```

For MSW:

```
npm install -D msw
```

Or all at once:

```
npm install -D vitest cypress msw
```

### Wrapping it up

Hereâ€™s the [same repository](https://github.com/diballesteros/react-testing/tree/c7530cd63f37c97d198e085a6d340f69ac330c4c) with the updated commit and all the packages correctly installed.

Now weâ€™re finally ready to dive headfirst into the intricacies of the testing libraries. Next time Iâ€™ll go over how Vitest and how to use its simple syntax.
