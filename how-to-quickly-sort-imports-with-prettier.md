## How to quickly sort imports with Prettier

### Introduction

Having disorganized imports bothers me deeply when working on a project. I typically like to keep the entire codebase as organized as possible as it makes sifting through the files much easier. With the help of prettier and a plugin, we can easily sort imports!

As a side note if you‚Äôre using ESLint I have [another article](https://relatablecode.com/how-to-quickly-configure-eslint-for-import-sorting/) to sort imports using that.

### Sort Imports: Setting everything up

First, let‚Äôs install the necessary dependencies. We‚Äôll need just two: prettier and the plugin üì¶.

```bash
npm install prettier @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports --save-dev
```

### Sort Imports: Configuring the Rules

Now we can go ahead and start configuring our rules. This plugin receives an array of strings. It uses these strings to decide the order of our imports!

So for example in my small sample project I have the following files:

![unsorted imports](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648645741874/BPISZd7-p.png)

So we‚Äôll have to set up the rules to configure them. I typically like the following order:

1. Package/third-party imports
2. Project imports
3. Relative imports

This will cover mostly everything! So let‚Äôs create a .prettierrc (a prettier configuration file) at the route of our project.

![prettierrc file](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648645743471/MD1Qh7yLV.png)

Inside that file add the following rule:

```
{ 
    "importOrder": ["^components/(.*)$", "^[./]" ],
    "importOrderSeparation": true, 
    "importOrderSortSpecifiers": true 
}
```

Let‚Äôs break down these options. They‚Äôre parsed through regex (yes I know the devil‚Äôs tongue). But it‚Äôs roughly the same format for every import type.

First, any type of regex that isn‚Äôt included will be sent to the top. This is **crucial. As the unincluded third-party** dependencies will just go to the top as we want. Afterward, we follow up without aliased **components** folder, and then our **relative** imports. I also have two additional rules to add linebreaks between the import groups and to sort specifiers in an import declaration

In this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports), you can find a list of the other rules that are available.

### Sort Imports: The Result

Now as soon as we save the file (if you happen to have format on saving in whichever IDE you‚Äôre using) or format the file you‚Äôll see the following result:

![sorted imports](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648645744985/FTmqbsgzE.png)

_Wow, that look‚Äôs much cleaner_ üëåüèº

### Conclusion

Hopefully, with that, you have more organized imports in your projects! If you have any other tidbits on how to clean up code leave them in the comments below!
